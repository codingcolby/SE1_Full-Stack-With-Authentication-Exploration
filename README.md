# Stewardship Exchange

##  Description

The STEWARDSHIP EXCHANGE is a free online resource for cultural heritage agencies to share surplus preservation and conservation material for collections care. Repositories typically have a surplus of new or gently used enclosures, supplies, tools, equipment, and furnishings that still have a useful life. Reducing, reusing, recycling, and repurposing helps save precious budget dollars for these non-profit organizations. This site aims to provide a communication forum for the collections care community to offer and claim these materials and as a by-product, foster new relationships, expanding professional networks. Registered users can create new offers, edit their offers, and create an Exchange Story to celebrate a successful transaction. 


# Solo Project Initialization - All of the below

We **STRONGLY** recommend following these instructions carefully. It's a lot, and will take some time to set up, but your life will be much easier this way in the long run. 

## Development Setup Instructions

* Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
* Run `npm run server`
* Run `npm run client`
* Navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Debugging

To debug, you will need to run the client-side separately from the server. Start the client by running the command `npm run client`. Start the debugging server by selecting the Debug button.

Then make sure `Launch Program` is selected from the dropdown, then click the green play arrow.

## Testing Routes with Postman

To use Postman with this repo, you will need to set up requests in Postman to register a user and login a user at a minimum. 

Keep in mind that once you using the login route, Postman will manage your session cookie for you just like a browser, ensuring it is sent with each subsequent request. If you delete the `localhost` cookie in Postman, it will effectively log you out.

1. Start the server - `npm run server`
2. [Import the sample routes JSON file](./PostmanPrimeSoloRoutes.json) by clicking `Import` in Passport. Select the file.
3. Click `Collections` and `Send` the following three calls in order:
    1. `POST /api/user/register` registers a new user, see body to change username/password
    2. `POST /api/user/login` will login a user, see body to change username/password
    3. `GET /api/user` will get user information, by default it's not very much

After running the login route above, you can try any other route you've created that requires a logged in user!


## Production Build

Before pushing to Heroku, run `npm run build` in terminal. This will create a build folder that contains the code Heroku will be pointed at. You can test this build by typing `npm start`. Keep in mind that `npm start` will let you preview the production build but will **not** auto update.

* Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
* Run `npm start`
* Navigate to `localhost:5000`

## Lay of the Land

* `src/` contains the React application
* `public/` contains static assets for the client-side
* `build/` after you build the project, contains the transpiled code from `src/` and `public/` that will be viewed on the production site
* `server/` contains the Express App

This code is also heavily commented. We recommend reading through the comments, getting a lay of the land, and becoming comfortable with how the code works before you start making too many changes. If you're wondering where to start, consider reading through component file comments in the following order:

* src/components
  * App/App
  * Footer/Footer
  * Nav/Nav
  * AboutPage/AboutPage
  * InfoPage/InfoPage
  * UserPage/UserPage
  * LoginPage/LoginPage
  * RegisterPage/RegisterPage
  * LogOutButton/LogOutButton
  * ProtectedRoute/ProtectedRoute

## Deployment

1. Create a new Heroku project
1. Link the Heroku project to the project GitHub Repo
1. Create an Heroku Postgres database
1. Connect to the Heroku Postgres database from Postico
1. Create the necessary tables
1. Add an environment variable for `SERVER_SESSION_SECRET` with a nice random string for security
1. In the deploy section, select manual deploy

## Update Documentation

Customize this ReadMe and the code comments in this project to read less like a starter repo and more like a project. Here is an example: https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2
